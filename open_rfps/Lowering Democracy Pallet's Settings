## Due Date
At next release

## Overview
Currently we have these problems with democracy pallet
- Normal proposals are executing in 1 to 2.5 months if they go without fasttrack
- Some tokens are locked at proposals queue due to long launch time period
- We are forced to fasttrack proposals and this creates queues at system since council and techcommitte cant pass proposals fast enough and this causes delays for RFPs and payments.
- Normally, important proposals like minting, runtime update proposals needs SuperMajorityApprove but since we fasttrack those, it becomes SimpleMajority
- Since we need techcommitte to fasttrack proposals, current democracy system kinda centralized

## Proposal goals
- Letting community members to propose proposals faster
- Lowering the delay for RFPs and payments
- Making current democracy system more decentralized by not needing fasttrack from techcommitte
- Making proposals more fair by keeping their vote treshold(SuperMajorityApprove/SimpleMajority) as default

## Scope of work
Chancing these settings at deomcracy pallet
- Lowering launch period times
- Lowering vote and execution time of proposals

## Current roadblocks and barriers to success
- Needing runtime update for these changes
